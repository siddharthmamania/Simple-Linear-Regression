# Simple-Linear-Regression

### In this regression task I have predicted the score of a student if he studies for 9.25 hours.
### This task was provided to me from The Spark Foundation as a part of my internship.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. If we plot the independent variable (x) on the x-axis and dependent variable (y) on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points
The Equation of line is Y = ax + b.
Where 'b' is the intercept, 'a' is the slope of the line.
